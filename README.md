# Evaluate News with Natural Language Processor
### Description
- We require aylien_textapi and instantiate the aylienApi variable and put in it the application_id and application_key and use dotenv for security by preventing the exposure of the private application_id and application_key. Then we access sentiment in aylienApi with the dot operator and use req.body.url as the first operator and we take it from formhandler.js that fetches this '/sentiment' path sending the req.body.url to it.

- The second parameter has error and response, error for error handling and response to be used to access polarity, subjectivity, and text from the Aylien API. They are then stored in the projectData object we are using as the endpoint. This object is then sent (by post) to the client side, turned into json format with .json(), and polarity, subjectivity, and text are accessed through res and added to the html file index.html by using innerHTML, finally displaying the data on-screen in the browser.

- Note that we have the else used in the if-else statement to handle invalid URLs with an alert and we have two jest tests one for formHandler.js and another for validateURL.js. Their names are formHandler.test.js and validateURL.test.js respectively. They test whether the result is defined or not with the toBeDefined method. I used the .gitignore file to ignore files that shouldn't be uploaded to github, the node_modules and dist folders, and the .env file as well for security.

- I used Webpack as a build-tool in this project with both development and production environments.
